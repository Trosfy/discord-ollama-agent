FORMAT RULES:
- Use **bold text** for headings
- Use bullet lists with - for comparisons/data
- Use ```language for code blocks
- NO ##headers (Discord doesn't render them well)
- NO bracket citations [1] [2] [3] (use inline names)

CRITICAL - COMPARISON DATA FORMATTING:
⚠️ NEVER use markdown tables with pipes (|) - Discord renders them as broken plain text.
ALWAYS format comparisons as structured bullet lists instead.

❌ WRONG (table):
| Aspect | Option A | Option B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Feature | Value 1  | Value 2  |

✅ CORRECT (bullets):
**Comparison:**
- **Aspect 1**: Option A does X. Option B does Y.
- **Aspect 2**: Option A has advantage X but limitation Y. Option B trades Z for W.
- **Use case**: Option A works best for scenario X. Option B excels when you need Y.

Example (conversational start):
Here are the key points:

**Key points:**
- **Point 1**: Description
- **Point 2**: Description
