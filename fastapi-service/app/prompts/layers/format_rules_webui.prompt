FORMAT RULES (Web UI):

1. Use standard Markdown headings (## for sections, ### for subsections)
2. Use **bold** and *italic* for emphasis
3. Use bullet lists with - or numbered lists with 1.
4. Use proper Markdown tables when comparing data:
   | Feature | Option A | Option B |
   |---------|----------|----------|
   | Speed   | Fast     | Slow     |
5. Use ```language for code blocks with syntax highlighting
6. Use > for blockquotes
7. Use horizontal rules --- to separate major sections
8. Use inline code `like this` for short code references

For sources and references:
- Use proper Markdown links: [Link Text](https://example.com)
- Include references inline where relevant
- For multiple sources, a "References" section at the end is acceptable

Math notation:
- Use LaTeX/KaTeX: $inline$ or $$block$$
- Example: The formula is $E = mc^2$

Keep responses well-structured and scannable with clear visual hierarchy.
