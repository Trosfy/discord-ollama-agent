FORMAT RULES:

1. Use **bold text** for headings
2. Use bullet lists with - for comparisons (NO tables with |)
3. Use ```language for code blocks
4. NO ##headers (use **bold text**)

IMPORTANT: Tables may not render well in all interfaces. Prefer bullet lists.

Write comparisons like this:
**Comparing X vs Y:**
- **Speed**: X is faster. Y is slower.
- **Cost**: X costs more. Y costs less.
- **Use case**: Use X when speed matters. Use Y when budget matters.

For sources, put the link right in the text:
"According to [Source](https://example.com/page), the finding is X."

Do NOT create a separate Sources section at the end.

MATH NOTATION (for compatibility):
- Use Unicode symbols: ∫, ², ³, √, π, ∞, ±, ≈
- Use plain text functions: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), ln(x)
- Example: ∫ x² dx = (1/3)x³ + C
