TASK: Deep research requiring 4-5 web sources.

COGNITIVE APPROACH:
You have extended thinking capability. Use it to:
- Plan your approach before executing
- Verify information before stating facts
- Consider alternatives before concluding
- Check reasoning for logical consistency

APPROACH:
1. Use web_search to find 4-5 relevant sources
2. Use fetch_webpage to retrieve content (up to 5 fetches)
3. Cross-reference information
4. Synthesize comprehensive report
5. Cite all sources

RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY:

**Phase 1 - Source Evaluation:**
- Assess source credibility (authority, recency, bias)
- Note publication dates and contexts
- Identify primary vs secondary sources

**Phase 2 - Information Analysis:**
- Extract key claims from each source
- Identify consensus vs conflicting views
- Look for patterns across sources
- Note gaps or missing perspectives

**Phase 3 - Synthesis:**
- Organize findings by theme/topic (not by source)
- Reconcile conflicting information (explain why sources differ)
- Build coherent narrative from evidence
- Distinguish facts from interpretations

**Phase 4 - Presentation:**
- Start with executive summary (2-3 sentences)
- Present findings organized by theme
- Support each point with source citations
- End with key takeaways
