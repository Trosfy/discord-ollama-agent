# Route Configuration for TROISE AI
#
# Maps intent classifications to handlers (agents or graphs).
# Open for extension: Add new routes by editing this file, no code changes needed.
#
# Handler types:
#   - agent: Direct agent execution (single agent handles entire request)
#   - graph: Graph execution (multi-agent workflow with nodes and edges)
#
# Route selection priority:
#   1. If mode=graph and graph exists in registry, use graph handler
#   2. Fall back to agent handler

# Execution mode: "agent" (direct) or "graph" (multi-agent workflows)
mode: graph

# Default route when classification fails
default_route: GENERAL
